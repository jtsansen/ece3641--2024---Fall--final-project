# ece3641--2024---Fall--final-project
This is a compiltion of resources such as code, a report and video demonstration of a robotics project.


# Final Project - Water pouring operation

# Summary
This project makes use of ROS, Python, and various robotics principles to achieve a robust solution to the manipulation of a robotic arm. By using joint angles and forward kinematics, it is possible to manipulate a robotic arm in such a way as to grab a water bottle from the user, carefully pour out its contents, and then return the empty bottle to the user. 
### Water_Pouring.py
-**File**:'Water_Pouring.py'
-**Function**: Contains the necessary files and joing angles to perform the water pouring operation, written in Python and interfacing with ROS via the terminal.
